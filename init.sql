This tropical cyclone seedling is expected to affect weather conditions and sea waves in parts of Indonesia for the next three days, December 6-8, 2024.',
    'The head of the BMKG, Dwikorita Karnawati, mentioned that the impacts would include moderate to heavy rains accompanied by lightning and strong winds in the regions of Lampung, Banten, West Java and Jakarta Greater Area (Jabodetabek). In the southern waters of the Sunda Strait, strong winds could reach approximately 15-25 knots (27-46 kilometers per hour).\n\nThe impact of these strong winds could cause high waves of 2.5-4.0 meters in the waters of Bengkulu - Enggano, western Lampung waters, Indian Ocean west of Bengkulu - Lampung, west and south of Sunda Strait, southern waters of Banten, Garut - Pangandaran waters, southwest of Banten, and southern Central Java in the Indian Ocean.\n\nIn addition, sea waves of 1.25 to 2.5 meters are predicted to occur in the area south of Bali to East Nusa Tenggara in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAt a higher atmospheric layer of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 meters), Dwikorita added that wind speeds could reach 35 knots (65 km/h), indicating significant weather potential in the surrounding areas. She urged the public to remain vigilant and cautious of possible extreme weather conditions.\n\n"Like mini-tornadoes, heavy rain accompanied by lightning, hail and possible impacts such as flooding, landslides, flash floods, waterlogging, strong winds, fallen trees, and slippery roads due to the presence of this cyclone seedling," Dwikorita said as quoted from a press release on Friday, December 6, 2024.\n\nShe suggested a temporary suspension of activities, especially for sea transport users and fishers. Dwikorita said the high waves could even reach 4 to 6 meters in the western part of Java''s southern waters. "We urge the public not to underestimate the presence of this cyclone seedling for our collective safety," she added.'

    'The Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) has demanded that the House of Representatives urgently evaluate the use of firearms by the National Police.',
    'Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (YLBHI) vice chairman Arif Maulana urged the House of Representatives'' Commission III to seriously evaluate the use of firearms by the National Police, saying that the officers are increasingly misusing the firearms. "Today, the situation is an emergency because of the abuse of firearms by the police," Arif told a press conference entitled "Emergency Police Reform" on Sunday, as reported by Tempo. \n\nRecently, there have been several cases involving the use of firearms by police officers, including the killing of a vocational high school student in Semarang on Nov. 24. Initially, the Semarang City Police accused the victim of being involved in a brawl, only to retract the accusation. \n\nOn Nov. 22, South Solok Police operations chief Adj. Comr. Dadang Iskandar shot dead his colleague chief detective Adj. Comr. Ryanto Ulil after the victim arrested suspected illegal miners. \n\nArif believes that the current condition of the National Police has strayed far from the original goals of police reform set out when the police separated from the then Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) in 1998. \n\nThe intention behind this separation was to change the police’s militaristic approach, making it more humane. \n\n"The police''s authority involves public service, law enforcement and security, [so] the police must be democratic and respect human rights, refraining from a violent approach," Arif said. Therefore, he supports the plan from House Commission III to evaluate the use of firearms within the police force. Arif said the plan needed to be carried out immediately, as not all police functions require firearms, pointing to the Traffic Corps as an example of a police force that does not need firearms. He said that the use of weapons, including firearms, should be a last resort in the context of law enforcement. \n\nPreviously, Commission III member Abdullah proposed that police officers be equipped only with batons for patrol duties to maintain order and security, rather than firearms, to prevent misuse. He pointed out that police forces in countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Botswana, New Zealand and Ireland only use batons and pepper spray to maintain order, with a strong emphasis on professionalism in their duties. He said that the evaluation and limitation of firearm use was crucial to prevent unwanted incidents, including civilian and police officer casualties. "Any weapon given to the police can be used to take someone''s life if the philosophical understanding and legal regulations are not well understood by the police officers," Abdullah said, as quoted by the Antara news agency. \n\nThe National Police budget for 2025 is set at Rp 126.62 trillion (US$7.98 billion), an increase of 7.85 percent from Rp 117 trillion in 2024.'

    'The program optimizes the use of state-owned land in urban areas as the locations for people’s housing in support of the 3 million houses program.',
    'Public Housing and Settlements Minister Maruarar “Ara” Sirait plans to coordinate with state-owned railway operator PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI) to develop a program for organizing residential areas around Manggarai Station in South Jakarta. The program is necessary to optimize the use of state-owned land in urban areas to be the locations for people’s housing in support of the 3 million houses program. "We hope that PT KAI can first conduct a survey and inventory of the housing on state-owned land around the Manggarai Station area," Maruarar said during his work visit to Manggarai Station, Jakarta, on Wednesday, as quoted by kompas.com. Maruarar made the visit with State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir. Before inspecting the Manggarai station area, the two ministers inspected an apartment constructed next to a station in Pondok Cina, Depok city. They then visited the Samesta Mahata Tanjung Barat apartment, which is located next to Tanjung Barat station in South Jakarta. "There are several points we want to assess. We will map out the opportunities, issues and preparedness, because there is a lot of idle state-owned land that has not been utilized or properly organized until now," said Maruarar during his visit. He believes that state-owned land, owned by KAI, could be used as a site for building affordable housing. Moreover, its location in a strategic urban area makes it suitable for developing decent housing for the community. The development of housing around KAI''s stations is adopting the transit-oriented development (TOD) concept for integrated residential areas. KAI currently partners with state-owned real estate developer Perum Perumnas in building four TOD housing projects at several station locations. These are Samesta Mahata Serpong at Rawa Buntu station in South Tangerang, Samesta Mahata Margonda at Pondok Cina station in Depok, Samesta Mahata Tanjung Barat at Tanjung Barat station in South Jakarta and Samesta Parayasa at Parung Panjang station in Bogor regency. For future TOD development, KAI has also identified five priority sites covering 17 hectares, all ready for integrated housing projects. There are also several locations being prepared in other cities, including Purwosari Station and Solo Balapan Station in Surakarta, Gubeng Station in Surabaya, Cicayur Station in Tangerang regency and Sudimara Station in South Tangerang. “As these vertical residences are close to railway transportation, it will make it easier for people to commute to work," Erick said.'

    '“There is no [slowdown in IKN development,]” Basuki told reporters at Menara Mandiri II, Jakarta, on Monday, December 9, 2024. “I don''t know that he is in the PU Ministry.”\n\nThe former minister of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) emphasized that the IKN Authority is preparing infrastructure development for the legislative and judiciary bodies, a task mandated by President Prabowo Subianto prior to his appointment as IKN Authority Head. Basuki also mentioned plans to submit a supplementary budget request of Rp8.1 trillion for the development of the new capital in 2025. The initial Budget Implementation List (DIPA) for OIKN in 2025 was set at Rp6.3 trillion. “Due to the President''s directive to commence construction of judicial, legislative, and residential offices, we are currently submitting a supplementary budget request to Bappenas (National Development Planning Agency) and the Ministry of Finance,” Basuki stated.\n\nRegarding the potential slowdown, Public Works Minister Dody Indra acknowledged that the development of IKN is not progressing at a 100% pace or strictly adhering to the initial schedule. He attributed this to the government''s current focus on other critical priorities, such as achieving national food self-sufficiency. The Ministry of Public Works will prioritize water supply for rice fields. “The IKN development is not significantly slow, just a slight delay. It''s simply a matter of prioritizing different objectives,” Dody told reporters at the Ministry of Public Works on Friday, December 6, 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Dody cited budget constraints as a contributing factor to the IKN development slowdown. He emphasized the government''s active pursuit of potential investors. “Funding is limited. We are actively seeking investment opportunities,” Dody stated. “We warmly welcome any entities interested in contributing to the IKN development.”'

    'Basuki only mentioned that the groundbreaking plan comes from domestic private company investments. "There will be offices, hotels, restaurants, and greenery projects," said Basuki when met at the IKN Authority Office in Jakarta on Monday, December 9, 2024. Basuki also disclosed that he’s trying to draw in Japanese property company Sojitz to participate in the groundbreaking. Basuki also did not confirm when the groundbreaking will take place, as it''s still awaiting approval from the Presidential Secretariat to adjust with President Prabowo Subianto’s schedule. The IKN Authority has carried out 8 phases of groundbreaking from 2023 to 2024 with a total investment value of Rp58 trillion. The investments are still below the IKN Authority''s target, which aims for Rp 100 trillion in investments in 2024. Former President Joko Widodo repeatedly claimed that investing in IKN would be akin to purchasing the future. One of the instances was during the 8th phase of groundbreaking a few months back on September 25, 2024. The former Governor of Jakarta also expressed the same thing during the groundbreaking for the Astra Biz Center and Nusantara Botanical Garden on June 4, 2024. "Investing in IKN is buying the future, buying an atmosphere that we cannot get elsewhere," said Jokowi as observed by Tempo in a live broadcast on the Presidential Secretariat''s YouTube channel.'

    'State-owned oil and gas company PT Pertamina (Persero) is lowering the price of aviation fuel at 19 priority airports across Indonesia. Pertamina President Director Simon Aloysius Mantiri said the policy was a step to reduce the price of air tickets ahead of the Christmas and New Year holiday season.',
    '"For the first time, with the support of encouragement from the SOE Ministry, the Ministry of Transportation, and of course through the direction of the President, we are also encouraging a decrease in ticket prices before Christmas and New Year," Simon said in a press conference at the SOE Ministry office in Jakarta on Monday, December 9.\n\nThe fare reduction is estimated to be around 7 percent of the normal price. The nominal amount varies, different at each airport. "We use the benchmark at Soekarno-Hatta Cengkareng Airport, which is already among the lowest prices compared to several other airports," he said.\n\nOn Pertamina''s official website, the current price of aviation fuel at Soekarno-Hatta Airport is shown at Rp12,688.2 per liter.\n\nSimon explained the policy has been officially implemented by the subholding of PT Pertamina Patra Niaga since December 1, 2024, and will end on January 9, 2025. The effect of the reduction in the price of aviation fuel, he said, is a reduction in the price of airline tickets in general.\n\n"From December 1 to 16, we will give flexibility to airlines, after which we will offer special prices for aviation fuel. The airlines will then regulate it as a whole, perhaps with cross-subsidies. That way, the overall prices of tickets can go down," he said.\n\nThe 19 airports include three main airports: Kuala Namu in Medan, I Gusti Ngurah Rai in Bali, and Juanda in Surabaya. There are also five super-priority tourist destination airports: Silangit in North Tapanuli, Lombok Airport, Komodo Airport in Labuan Bajo, Sam Ratulangi Airport in Manado, and Kulonprogo Airport in Yogyakarta.\n\n"The remaining 11 airports are priority airports during the year-end holiday season, namely Supadio, Pattimura, Hasanuddin, Sepinggan, El Tari, Sorong Daratan, Mozes Kilangin, Sentani, Wai Oti, Paniai and Frans Kaisiepo," he said.\n\nEarlier, President Director of PT Aviasi Pariwisata Indonesia (Persero) or InJourney, Maya Watono, said the policy of reducing airfares was one of three factors that play an important role in reaching a 10-percent reduction in airfares during the Christmas and New Year period.\n\nThe second and third factors are the reduction in tariffs for services provided by airlines, which include aircraft landing, parking, and storage services or PJP4U, and the third factor is the reduction in the price of aviation fuel used by PT Pertamina (Persero).'

Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the bar for a possible nuclear attack.\n\n"This marks a renewed build up in tensions in the Russia-Ukraine war and brings back into focus the risk of supply disruptions in the oil market," ANZ analysts said in a note to clients.\n\nSigns that China, the world''s largest crude importer, may have stepped up oil purchases this month after a period of weak imports boosted oil price sentiment.\n\nData from vessel tracker Kpler showed China''s crude imports are on track to end November at or close to record highs, an analyst told Reuters.\n\nWeak imports by China so far this year have pulled down oil prices, with Brent sinking 20% from its April peak of more than $92 a barrel.'

    'With everything that is within our scope of responsibilities, sometimes things fall through the cracks. From skipped breakfasts to late night cravings, it’s easy to get sucked into an unhealthy eating habit. Coupled with excess emotional drainage from stress, and the results can be shocking come general checkup day. Putting on weight is part and parcel of your eating habits, but when the kilograms pile up, it can mean something has gone wrong. While we believe that we can handle all the responsibilities and live a healthy lifestyle, sometimes our physical needs need a little push in the right direction. Today, more and more people are raising awareness about nutrition and the vitality of physical activities. Being more careful about what they put in their body will also be more important in the long run. Yet, in the hustle and bustle of the big city, where a second seemed to go by faster than the usual "New York minute," some have to get creative on how to watch their daily intake on-the-go. Femmy Fyber, a low-calorie fiber drink by Bintang Toedjoe, a Kalbe company, offers high fiber content with inulin and lipase enzymes to help maximize metabolism and fat burning processes to keep the body healthy and in shape. With its tagline of Rahasia Body Ideal Aku dan Kamu! (Our Secret to an Ideal Body), the drink also contains a high dose of vitamin C, vitamin D and a mixture of vegetables including garcinia and spirulina, sweetened with stevia. While there are many similar brands of supplement drinks in Indonesia, Femmy Fyber recently garnered public interest through the story of Kiky Saputri, a well-known comedian that lost 4.5 kilograms in 14 days. She made it clear, however, that her diet was also supported by living a healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly and eating nutritious food. The brand also launched a digital campaign, entitled “Give Birth to Fat,” which invites consumers to start a new and healthier lifestyle with the drink. The inspiration behind the tagline is taken from the common misconception for women online of appearing to be pregnant based on their weight. The campaign clarifies that an inflated belly does not suggest pregnancy, but it is instead usually excess abdominal fat. By drinking Femmy Fyber, consumers will be able to “give birth” to their fat and to a new figure. With placement on various digital platforms, the Femmy Fyber digital campaign recorded 43 million hits and achieved 46 million impressions, exceeding its initial performance indicator by a total of 238 percent and 171 percent respectively. It also won an award at the Indonesia Brand Communication Excellence 2024 Awards on Aug. 9, organized by MIX Marketing & Communication and SWA Media Group. Fiber is an important part of digestive health, and a diet high in fiber can help balance cholesterol levels, prevent constipation and control blood sugar levels. Beyond fitting in a vintage Valentino dress, this ensures that an ideal body means a healthy one.'

    'The path to Indonesia’s future lies in a smart, healthy and competitive golden generation, shaped through optimal child growth and development.',
    'Reaffirming its commitment to support Indonesia''s future leaders, PT Kalbe Farma Tbk (Kalbe) through its subsidiary Kalbe Consumer Health and the Sakatonik ABC brand has focused its attention on addressing dietary problems in children. In line with Kalbe''s sustainability initiative Bersama Sehatkan Bangsa (Together to Make the Nation Healthy), Sakatonik ABC’s through Semangat Makan Sehat #MakanHapHapHap campaign introduced the ABC Method and ABC Nutri Meter to helps parent to monitor kid''s development. “This campaign also celebrates National Children''s Day 2024 as well as an effort to understand parents'' concerns regarding appetite problems that impact children''s growth and development," explained Kalbe Consumer Health vitamin category Head Adelia Theresia. The ABC method highlights three important aspects of children’s nutrition that parents need to pay attention. First, the adequate and nutritious food intake, vitamins that support children''s growth and development as well as regular checking of children''s weight and hygiene. Highlighting childrens’ need for vitamins, Sakatonik ABC launched the Sakatonik ABC Curcuma Madu, a chewable tablet vitamin containing curcuma extract, honey and essential multivitamins, designed to increase children''s appetite and support immune systems. Kalbe Consumer Health Senior Brand Manager Chitra Ariesta said the bee-shaped chewable tablet likes by kids and differ from similar products that generally come in syrup form, adding that a 2024 Indonesian Home Tester survey found 9 out of 10 mothers agreed that Sakatonik ABC Curcuma Madu in chewable tablet form is practical and easy for children to consume. According to Secretary General of the Indonesian Medical Association (PB IDI) Dr. Ulul Albab, Sp.OG., around 20 to 50 percent of children who grow normally and 70 to 89 percent of children with developmental disorders are reported to experience various types of feeding issues, including poor appetite. "If this occurs over an extended period of time, it can negatively affect growth to the point of malnutrition, which results in the child having a risk of death that is almost 12 times higher than those who receive adequate nutrition. This proves that children''s nutritional health is very important for their optimal growth and development," he added. Based on data from the Health Ministry’s 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, 1 out of 12 toddlers experience wasting, 1 out of 7 toddlers suffer from stunting, 1 out of 4 toddlers experience anemia and 1 out of 13 children are overweight. One way to check the nutritional status and growth of children is through the World Health Organization growth curve, which is currently being developed further by IDI and Kalbe Consumer Health in the form of the ABC Nutri Meter, a web-based application to monitor children''s nutritional development conditions, which will be launched in Q4 2024. The ABC Nutri Meter utilizes the WHO growth curve and the ECAST questionnaire as a reference to check children’s nutritional status, detect eating disorders and provide the relevant recommendations. The app only requires the child''s weight, height, gender and age, followed by a questionnaire about the child''s appetite and immune system. “In addition to checking the nutritional status and growth of the children, the ABC Nutri Meter can also be used by adolescents to determine the risk of anemia and suggest treatments," said Chitra. This article is in partnership with Sakatonic ABC.'

    'For decades, the illness long known as "monkeypox" was restricted to a handful of African countries, with estimates of its mortality rate ranging from one to 10 percent of people infected.',
    'As fears mount globally about mpox, apparently simple questions such as the danger it poses and differences between variants do not have clear and simple answers. The World Health Organization in July declared an international health emergency over the spread of mpox, which first appeared in humans around 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). For decades, the illness long known as "monkeypox" was restricted to a handful of African countries, with estimates of its mortality rate ranging from one to 10 percent of people infected. That uncertainty grew from 2022, when mpox spread elsewhere in the world, especially to Western countries. Cases in these newly-infected states had very low mortality of around 0.2 percent. Such differences likely stem from several variables. First, someone living in the US or Europe is much more likely to receive swift, appropriate medical treatment than patients in most African nations. The danger mpox presents "strongly depends on the quality of basic care," said Antoine Gessain, a virologist specializing in the disease. The mortality rate measured in the current outbreak -- around 3.6 percent -- would therefore likely be much lower were it not mostly limited to the DRC. Other factors weighing on the mortality rate include those that make some patients more vulnerable than others. The vast majority of the deaths recorded in the DRC -- over 500 out of more than 15,000 mpox cases -- have been children, many of whom are affected by malnutrition in the country. By contrast, in the DRC''s 2022-2023 epidemic, the very small number of people who died -- around 200 out of 100,000 cases -- were mostly adults whose immune system was already weakened by HIV infection. Different mortality outcomes can also be explained by the way a disease is spread. In 2022-2023, most transmission was via sex between homosexual or bisexual men. A further factor adding complexity is the clade, or family, to which the specific virus causing an mpox outbreak belongs. Scientists are struggling to determine the differences between clades when it comes to health risks and transmission. The 2022-2023 mpox epidemic was caused by Clade 2 mpox, which is mostly present in western Africa, but also found in South Africa. DRC''s deadly current outbreak stems from Clade 1 mpox, mostly found in the continent''s central areas. But a distinct second epidemic hitting mostly adults in the same country is linked to variant 1b, a derivative of Clade 1 that has only appeared recently. Confusion in the media has led some outlets to call variant 1b more dangerous than previously-existing mpox varieties. "There are rather big claims in the popular media for which evidence is limited, both about severity and about transmissibility of the new sublineage 1b," Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans told the UK-based Science Media Center. "What we do know is that Clade 1 is associated with more severe disease than Clade 2," she added. In the past, Clade 1 outbreaks have been associated with higher mortality rates than Clade 2. But researchers call for caution before drawing conclusions, even with apparently clear-cut figures. The urgency of establishing the facts about mpox variants is all the greater as Clade 1 was detected in Sweden in mid-July -- for the first time outside Africa. "It''s very difficult to compare" between different clades "given that the context and the type of at-risk population are so important," virologist Gessain said. "How can you compare children suffering from malnutrition and HIV-positive adults?" he asked.'

    'In July 2022, the WHO declared an emergency over the international outbreak of the less severe Clade 2b strain of mpox, which mostly affected men who have sex with men. The alarm was lifted in May 2023.',
    'The mpox outbreak is not another Covid-19, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, because much is already known about the virus and the means to control it. While more research is needed on the Clade 1b strain which triggered the UN agency into declaring an international health emergency, the spread of mpox can be reined in, the WHO''s European director Hans Kluge said. "Mpox is not the new COVID," he said. "We know how to control mpox. And, in the European region, the steps needed to eliminate its transmission altogether," he told a media briefing in Geneva, via video-link. In July 2022, the WHO declared an emergency over the international outbreak of the less severe Clade 2b strain of mpox, which mostly affected men who have sex with men. The alarm was lifted in May 2023. "We controlled mpox in Europe thanks to the direct engagement with the most affected communities," said Kluge. Robust surveillance, investigating case contacts, behavior changes in the affected communities and vaccination all contributed to controlling the outbreak, he said. Kluge said the risk to the general population was low. "Are we going to go in lockdown in the WHO European region, [as if] it''s another Covid-19? The answer is clearly: ''no''," he said. Clade 1b is spreading mainly through sexual transmission among adults. Kluge said it was also possible that someone in the acute phase of mpox infection, especially with blisters in the mouth, may transmit the virus to close contacts by droplets, in circumstances such as in the home or in hospitals. "The modes of transmission are still a bit unclear. More research is required," he said. WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency was not recommending the use of masks. "We are not recommending mass vaccination. We are recommending using vaccines in outbreak settings for the groups who are most at risk," he added. The WHO declared an international health emergency on August 14, concerned by the rise in cases of Clade 1b in the DR Congo and its spread to nearby countries. Clade 1 split There are two subtypes of mpox: the more virulent and deadlier Clade 1, endemic in the Congo Basin in central Africa; and Clade 2, endemic in West Africa. Clade 1b is a new offshoot of Clade 1, which is now called Clade 1a. The Clade 1b outbreak in northeastern DRC was first detected in September last year and is spreading rapidly. Catherine Smallwood, WHO Europe''s emergency operations program area manager, explained that the split of Clade 1 into 1a and 1b reflects "change in the evolution of the virus." Clade 1a traditionally has outbreaks resulting from infections from sick animals, with some limited follow-on transmission between humans at the household level, or within communities. But with Clade 1B, "we have not isolated or detected zoonotic transmission of Clade 1b," said Smallwood. "So it seems to be a strain of the virus that''s circulating exclusively within the human population." Experts are trying to work out if there is a difference in disease severity between Clades 1a and 1b. Vaccines The available vaccines were originally developed for smallpox, and are effective against other viruses in the wider orthopoxvirus family, such as mpox. Two mpox vaccines have been used in recent years -- MVA-BN, produced by Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, and Japan''s LC16. There is also ACAM2000, a second-generation smallpox jab approved in the United States. Whether a person vaccinated post-exposure to mpox goes on to develop the disease depends on the early administration of the vaccine, said Smallwood. Vaccines can also be used preventatively in people likely to be exposed to the virus. Jasarevic said results from effectiveness studies indicated that a good level of protection was provided against mpox following vaccination. However, it takes several weeks to develop immunity after being vaccinated.'

    'Worried by the rise in cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the spread to nearby countries, the WHO hastily convened a meeting of experts to study the outbreak.',
    'The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the mpox surge in Africa a global public health emergency, sounding its highest possible alarm over the worsening situation. Worried by the rise in cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the spread to nearby countries, the WHO hastily convened a meeting of experts to study the outbreak. "Today, the emergency committee met and advised me that in its view, the situation constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. I have accepted that advice," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference. A PHEIC is the highest level of alarm under the International Health Regulations, which are legally binding on 196 countries. "The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighboring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying," said Tedros. "It''s clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives. This is something that should concern us all." The UN health agency''s decision comes the day after the African Union''s health watchdog declared its own public health emergency over the growing outbreak. Tedros said the more than 14,000 cases and 524 deaths reported so far this year in DR Congo had already exceeded last year''s total. "The emergence last year and rapid spread of clade 1b in DRC, which appears to be spreading mainly through sexual networks, and its detection in countries neighboring DRC is especially concerning," he said, citing Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. Dimie Ogoina, who chaired the emergency committee, said the 15 members present unanimously thought the mpox upsurge was an extraordinary event. He said many members feared the known situation in Africa was "actually the tip of the iceberg", because without more robust surveillance, "we don''t have the full picture". Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO''s epidemic and pandemic preparedness and prevention director, insisted: "We can stop transmission of mpox with a concerted effort." But she said experts needed a "much better understanding of the epidemiology" and the transmission patterns, which would help make sure the limited number of vaccines could be deployed to best effect. Two vaccines for mpox are recommended by WHO immunization experts. Formerly called monkeypox, the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC. Mpox is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact. The disease causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions. It is the second PHEIC in succession on mpox -- albeit one focused on a different, and more deadly, strain of the virus. In May 2022, mpox infections surged worldwide, mostly affecting gay and bisexual men, due to the clade 2b subclade. The WHO declared a public health emergency which lasted from July 2022 to May 2023. The outbreak, which has now largely subsided, caused some 140 deaths out of around 90,000 cases. The clade 1b subclade, which has been surging in the DRC since September 2023, causes more severe disease than clade 2b, with a higher fatality rate. A PHEIC has only been declared seven times previously since 2009: over H1N1 swine flu, poliovirus, Ebola, Zika virus, Ebola again, Covid-19 and mpox. Marion Koopmans, director of the Pandemic and Disaster Management Centre at Erasmus University Rotterdam, said a PHEIC declaration raises the alert globally. But "the same priorities remain: investing in diagnostic capacity, public health response, treatment support and vaccination", she said, warning that this would be a challenge as the DRC and its remains are lacking resources. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was scaling up preparedness measures across Africa, notably in the heavily affected eastern DRC. With its broad network, the IFRC said it was prepared to "play a crucial role in containing the spread of the disease, even in the hard-to-reach areas where the need is the greatest".'

    'This is the season for joy, laughter, and cherished moments with loved ones. But as the holiday season approaches, it is also important to protect yourself and your family from the flu.',
    'What is Flu? Influenza (flu) is a contagious viral illness. Anyone can get the flu. It spreads from one person to another by droplets and airborne particles the virus is attached to through coughing and sneezing.\n\nSymptoms start suddenly, are often more severe than a “common cold,” and usually last for 3-5 days. They include fever, headache, sore throat, cough, runny nose, body aches, and often extreme tiredness.\n\nDid you know? Thousands of vulnerable people die from influenza globally each year.\n\nInfluenza Vaccination\nFlu vaccination is normally given as an injection. It contains three or four strains of inactivated (killed) influenza viruses. Protection begins about two weeks after vaccination and lasts throughout the flu season.\n\nThe flu virus constantly changes, so there is a new vaccine developed and available every year to match these changes in the virus. Anyone (except those under 6 months old and for whom vaccination is contraindicated) who wants to reduce their risk of flu should consider an annual vaccination.\n\nFlu vaccination is especially important for the following people, as they are more likely to suffer serious complications from an infection:\n- Young children;\n- Adults over 65 years old;\n- Anyone with a chronic medical condition, including diabetes, heart, or lung disease;\n- Pregnant women.\n\nTo help protect your loved ones from infection, anyone in close contact with those listed above should be vaccinated. Your doctor can advise whether vaccination is suitable for you.\n\nPossible Side Effects\nThe vaccines are safe and, usually, without issues. However, after your vaccination, you need to stay close by for 15 minutes in case you have a reaction.\n\nIt is common to develop some mild soreness, swelling, and redness at the injection site. It settles on its own after 1-2 days. Mild fever, tiredness, and muscle aches are also fairly common and can last one or two days. This is not the flu, even if symptoms can imitate some mild forms of the symptoms.\n\nSerious side effects, such as hives, swelling of the face, wheezing, and life-threatening allergy (anaphylaxis), are rare. If they do happen, it is within minutes or hours of receiving the vaccine. Don’t hesitate to contact your doctor for further consultation.\n\nInfluenza can be a serious disease. Vaccination is an effective and safe way to reduce your risk of getting flu and spreading it to others.'

    'Depression is a real illness with real symptoms. It is not a sign of weakness or something you can “snap out of” by “pulling yourself together.”',
    'Being in a new country can be exciting, but it can also be stressful. Do you know your way around this huge city? Language issues, making new friends, adjusting to a new job, or not having a job can all influence your well-being. Many life events and situations that can trigger stress. What happens when these stressful events get on top of you? Do you feel low because of that? Could this be the beginning of depression?\n\nFeeling depressed is more than simply feeling unhappy, hopeless, or worthless. You might feel fed up for a few days. However, these symptoms have to be present every day, most of the day for at least two weeks.\n\nMost people go through periods of feeling low or down, but when you’re really depressed, you feel sad and down for weeks or months, rather than just a few days.\n\nSome people think depression is not a real health condition. That is not correct. Depression is a real illness with real symptoms. It is not a sign of weakness or something you can “snap out of” by “pulling yourself together.”\n\nTreatment however is possible.\n\nHow do you know if you have depression?\nDepression can present with different symptoms and will affect people differently.\n\nYou may feel unhappy and hopeless. Or you lose interest in the things you used to enjoy and you feel tearful. Many people with depression also have anxiety.\n\nPhysical symptoms can include feeling tired, sleeping badly, less appetite or sex drive, and body aches and pains.\n\nYou may feel low in spirit all the time while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living.\n\nMost people can have feelings of stress, anxiety, or low mood during difficult times. The symptoms will last for more than two weeks, at least when it is depression.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\nIt’s important to seek help from a GP (GOOD PRACTICE) or medical professional if you think you may be depressed.\n\nPeople can wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it is best not to delay. The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery.\n\nWhat causes depression?\nSometimes there is a clear trigger for depression. Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job, the end of a relationship, or giving birth, can bring it on.\n\nA family history of depression can also make it more likely to experience depression. However, you can also become depressed for no obvious reason.\n\nHow to treat depression\nLifestyle changes, talking therapies, and medicine are the main options for treatment. Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is.\n\nIf you have mild depression, your family doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own while monitoring your progress. This is known as “watchful waiting.” Lifestyle measures, such as exercise and guided self-help, can also be suggested.\n\nTalking therapies, such as COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), may also be used to treat depression. For CBT, it is best to see a psychologist. GOOD PRACTICE can help you if you need an English-speaking therapist.\n\nFor moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and medication (antidepressants) is often recommended. If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist like a psychiatrist for intensive, specialist talking treatment and prescribed medicine.\n\nLiving with depression\nMany people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, refraining from alcohol as well as smoking, and eating healthily. Looking after your health in general will have a positive effect on your depression.\n\nReading about depression can make you understand depression. Sharing your experiences with others who are in a similar situation can also be very helpful.\n\nA word of advice\nTalk to a trusted medical practitioner. A good GP can ask you the correct questions to find out more about your mental state of health. The sooner you discuss your symptoms, the sooner you can be helped. There are several options and a tailor-made plan can be designed for you. English-speaking professionals are, for instance, available at the GOOD PRACTICE clinic.'

    'Deaths related to HIV, which are generally caused by other diseases during the late stages of AIDS, fell by about 40 percent to below a million a year, a study has found.',
    'The number of new HIV infections and deaths has fallen across the world, marking significant progress in the fight against the disease. But HIV is far from being stamped out, health experts warn ahead of World AIDS Day on Sunday. During the 2010s, the number of HIV infections across the world declined by a fifth, according to a major study published in The Lancet HIV journal on Tuesday. Deaths related to HIV, which are generally caused by other diseases during the late stages of AIDS, fell by about 40 percent to below a million a year, the study said. The decline was mainly driven by improving rates in sub-Saharan Africa, which is by far the hardest-hit region in the global epidemic. However infections did not go down everywhere. Other regions, such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East, saw HIV numbers increase. And the world remains far from the United Nations target of virtually eradicating AIDS-related deaths by 2030, the researchers said.\n\n"The world has made remarkable global progress to significantly reduce the number of new HIV infections," said lead study author Hmwe Kyu of the US-based Institute For Health Metrics and Evaluation. "More than a million people acquire a new HIV infection each year and, of the 40 million people living with HIV, a quarter are not receiving treatment," she said in a statement.\n\nPreventative treatments called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) have proven to be a powerful tool in the fight against HIV. These daily pills reduce the risk of getting HIV from sex by around 99 percent. They have helped drive down HIV rates in many countries. In some, such as France, health authorities are urging PrEP to be made more available to more people, rather than just men who have sex with men. "It is something that can be used by anyone who needs it at some point in their sexual life," French infectious disease specialist Pierre Delobel told a press conference.\n\nFor people who have been infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy can reduce the amount of the virus in their blood to undetectable levels. An undetectable viral load means that there is less than a one percent chance that breastfeeding mothers pass HIV onto their babies, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThese tools have worked well in wealthier countries but the high costs have meant that poorer countries -- such as in Africa -- have often been left behind. There are fears that this history could repeat for a new drug that has been hailed as a potential game-changer in the battle against HIV. Early trials have found that the antiretroviral treatment lenacapavir is 100 percent effective in preventing HIV infection. And it only needs to be injected twice a year, making the drug far easier to administer than current regimens requiring daily pills.\n\nUS pharmaceutical giant Gilead has been charging around $40,000 per person per year for the treatment in several countries. But researchers have estimated the drug could be made for as little as $40, calling on Gilead to allow for cheaper access in hard-hit nations. Last month, Gilead announced it had signed licensing deals with six generic drugmakers to produce and sell lenacapavir in lower-income countries. While experts largely welcomed the move, some noted that millions of people with HIV live in countries not included in the deal. The twice-yearly injection is also hoped to help get around another problem for administering HIV drugs -- the stigma that comes along with having the disease.\n\nDespite decades of effort, a vaccine for HIV remains elusive. But the lenacapavir shot is "like having a vaccine basically," Andrew Hill, a researcher at the UK''s Liverpool University, told AFP earlier this year. A handful of patients have also been effectively cured of HIV. But these cures happen only after a patient endures a brutal stem cell transplant for their leukemia, so it is not an option for almost all people living with HIV.'

    'A Look at the Origins of Petrichor, the Distinctive Smell of Rain',

    'When the rain falls, the petrichor scent starts to be wafted. This gentle scent is often described as the smell of rain, earth, or nature. The petrichor scent also helps transform a person''s environment.',
    'As quoted from Green Turf, the combination of petrichor aroma and the peaceful sound of raindrops provide a strong sense of relief in the human brain. This scent can alleviate anxiety or depression and help alleviate temporary symptoms due to human innate biophilia.\n\nSo, where does the smell of rain or petrichor come from?\n\nPetrichor was introduced by two scientists from Australia, Isabel Joy Bear and Richard Grenfell, in 1964. They defined petrichor as a unique scent that appears after rain falls on dry soil. They found that this unique scent emerges from the release of various volatile compounds by plants and microbes.\n\nPetrichor comes from the Greek language consisting of two words, namely petra and ichor. Petra or petros means stone, while ichor means the noble blood of gods and goddesses. The petrichor scent originates from actinomycetes bacteria. During the dry season, these plants produce oil that is absorbed by the soil.\n\nWhen it rains, this oil is released into the air along with other compounds. One of them is geosmin, a metabolic byproduct of actinobacteria. Geosmin contains 79.06 percent oxygen, 12.17 percent hydrogen, and 8.77 percent oxygen. When it rains, geosmin is released from the soil and mixes with ozone molecules.\n\nThunderstorms also play a role in creating petrichor by generating electrical discharge in the atmosphere. This produces a clean and sharp ozone scent. Professor Maribeth Stolzenburg from the University of Mississippi explains that thunderstorms, especially during rain, improve air quality. Most of the dust, aerosols, and other particulates that come into contact with rainwater make the air clean.\n\nFurthermore, acid rain also affects the formation of the rain or petrichor scent. These acids come from the soil and plants known as Palmitic acid and Stearic acid. Sometimes, petrichor formed from these acids can make the rain scent unpleasant and undesirable to smell.\n\nBecause these acidic chemicals are found in organic debris such as bacterial spores, fuel residues, and so on. The more infrequently the rain falls in an area, the first rain will release a stronger petrichor than usual.\n\nOn the other hand, the rain scent may also be influenced by the flora in an area. Some plants release oil during dry periods. When it rains, the oil scent is released into the air. Stearic and palmitic acid can add to the rain scent.\n\nAnother scent related to rain is ozone. When lightning breaks down oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere, then recombines into nitric oxide. This substance interacts with other chemicals in the atmosphere to form ozone. When someone can smell the rain scent, the wind may have carried ozone until it is inhaled into the nose.'

    'Several astronomical phenomena will color the sky throughout December 2024. One of the spectacular events is the Geminid meteor shower. During its peak period, this phenomenon can produce 120 meteors per hour.',
    'According to information from Bosscha Observatory in Lembang, West Bandung, the Geminid meteor shower will occur starting tonight, December 4, until December 17. The peak of the Geminid meteor shower is predicted to take place on December 14, 2024.\n\nIf the sky is clear and not cloudy, this phenomenon can be observed starting from 8:00 PM Western Indonesian Time (WIB) until dawn. These meteors originate from the Gemini constellation, so their position in the sky is northeast, between north and east.\n\nAnother sky phenomenon that will occur this month is the solstice or sun''s turning point. On December 21, around 4:20 PM WIB, the sun will cross the north or south solstice line. As a result, the nighttime in the northern hemisphere will be longer than the daytime, while the southern hemisphere will have longer daylight.\n\nThe sun''s turning point also signifies the arrival of winter in the northern hemisphere and the beginning of summer in the southern hemisphere. The next sun''s turning point will be in March 2025, marking the spring season in the north and autumn in the south.\n\nBosscha Observatory also stated there will be several conjunctions of planets in alignment. On December 5, 2024, the moon and Venus will appear close together in the western sky. This phenomenon can be observed from sunset until around 9:00 PM WIB.\n\nOn December 15, the moon and Jupiter will also appear close together in the eastern sky. The conjunction can be seen at 6:15 PM WIB, then the position shifts towards the sky in the early hours at 2:42 AM WIB. The moon will also be near Mars in the eastern sky on December 18, 2024, starting from 9:20 PM WIB until dawn.\n\nMercury is also predicted to be visible briefly in the eastern sky on December 25 in the early hours at 4:00 AM WIB. Mercury will also be seen in conjunction with the moon in the eastern sky on December 29.'

    'Bali’s natural beauty is world-renowned, yet beneath its pristine beaches lies a growing environmental crisis.',
    'The island produces an alarming 1.6 million tonnes of waste annually, including 330,000 tonnes of plastic. With ineffective waste management, much of this waste remains uncollected, polluting rivers and oceans. This threatens Bali’s delicate ecosystem, the livelihoods of local communities, and the tourism industry on which it heavily relies.\n\nIn response, a coalition of forward-thinking businesses has launched the Community Waste Project—an innovative initiative aimed at reducing Bali’s landfill waste and setting a benchmark for sustainability in Indonesia.\n\nWaste Cleaning & StoringWaste Cleaning & Storing\n\n**A Collaborative Approach to Change**\nLed by Mexicola Group, Potato Head Family, and Total Bangun Persada, in collaboration with Brunch Club, Finns, Kynd, Lemongrass, and Peppers Seminyak, the initiative is set to open a 2,000-square-metre waste facility in October 2024. Located near Suwung, Bali’s largest landfill in Denpasar, the facility will transform the island’s waste into valuable resources for the hospitality sector.\n\nRooted in the principles of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recreate, and Regenerate, the Community Waste Project pioneers a sustainable model for the hospitality industry. With an initial investment of $400,000, the centre will process organic, inorganic, and garden waste through advanced sorting, composting, recycling, and upcycling techniques.\n\nThe project will create practical products for businesses, such as compost and upcycled plastic panels, fostering a circular economy that benefits the environment and local enterprises. Participating businesses will have access to these products at cost price, ensuring sustainability remains affordable.\n\n**An Ambitious Goal: 5% Landfill Waste**\nBali’s waste management system is under severe strain, with 52% of the island’s waste mismanaged. Hotels and businesses contribute around 13% of Bali’s total waste, much of which ends up in landfills. The Community Waste Project aims to reduce landfill waste from participating businesses from over 50% to just 5%.\n\nKey to this success is waste separation at the source. Potato Head Family will lead efforts, guiding businesses to sort waste effectively into organic and non-organic categories. Eco-champions at each business will ensure proper waste segregation before it is collected and processed at the facility.\n\nAs a non-profit initiative, all profits from upcycled products will be reinvested into the community and used to fund additional waste management centres across Bali. The initiative, led by Desa Potato Head, plans to expand if successful, aiming to include at least 10 more hospitality businesses by 2024. The long-term vision is to establish a sustainable waste management model that is replicable across Indonesia.'

    'Fighter jets have long been at the forefront of military aviation. These aircraft are primarily deployed for the purpose of ensuring the security of the airspace, Britannica notes.',
    'In the modern era, countries have been developing a series of cutting-edge fighter aircraft. These advanced machines are the pinnacle of speed, stealth, and precision, which are such feasts for aviation enthusiasts.\n\nCiting Aerotime, Simple Flying, and other sources, let’s take a look at some of the best fighter jets in the world, showcasing unrivaled capabilities.\n\n1. Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II\n\nWe start off this list with the formidable Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. As mentioned on Lockheed Martin’s website, the F-35 has been instrumental in strengthening national security, as well as enhancing global partnerships and powers economic growth.\n\nThe aircraft entered production in 2006. Comprising three variants, the F-35 was built to showcase unparalleled stealth with a multitude of features including sensor fusion, powerful fighter engine, advanced radar, data networking capabilities, and more.\n\nGiven the cutting-edge technologies in the F-35, it’s not an overstatement to call it one of the best fighter jets in the world.\n\n2. Chengdu J-20 Mighty Dragon\n\nNicknamed the "Mighty Dragon", the Chengdu J-20 is China’s first fifth-generation fighter jet. The machine was introduced back in 2017 and it beckons aircraft enthusiasts with stealth and powerful engine.\n\nWhile information regarding the specifications remains confidential, Business Insider revealed that the J-20 can achieve at least an impressive range of 1,000 nautical miles. Furthermore, the so-called Mighty Dragon was initially to rival the F-22 and the Su-57.\n\n3. Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor\n\nOften hailed as the first true fifth-generation fighter jet to enter service, the F-22 is reputable for its stealth features. The powerhouse, flying for the first time in 1997, is equipped with cutting-edge thrust-vectoring engines and weapon systems, enabling it to excel in close-range combat scenarios.\n\nBeyond that, the F-22 also stands out for its maneuverability. According to Britannica, it is capable of reaching high speed without afterburning.\n\n4. KAI KF-21 Boramae\n\nThe KF-21 Boramae is the outcome of South Korea and Indonesia’s partnership. At a glance, the fighter jet may have some resemblance to the F-22 Raptor. The body of the aircraft is blackish-gray and has an estimated length of up to 16.7 meters. The wingspan reaches 10.6 meters.\n\nAs Tempo reported, the KF-21 Boramae is armed with the M61 20-millimeter Gatling gun. With regard to the engine, the jet is equipped with a General Electric F414. This engine is of the same type as that used in the Boeing Company\'s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter.\n\nFurthermore, the KF-21 Boramae has an estimated maximum thrust of up to 19,000 kilograms. It is also capable of hitting a maximum flying speed of 22 thousand kilometers per hour.\n\n5. Sukhoi Su-57\n\nRounding off our list of the best fighter jets in the world is Russia’s first stealth aircraft, Sukhoi Su-57. The jet embodies a blend of speed and durability. In particular, the Su-57 incorporates thrust vectoring and is capable of carrying substantial munitions loads.\n\nThis particular aircraft is significant in the Russo-Ukrainian war. The Su-35 has demonstrated its versatility by launching anti-radiation missiles, GPS-guided glide bombs, and long-range air-to-air missiles.\n\nIn the ever-evolving world of aviation, fighter jets play a critical role in maintaining national security and projecting power. Each of these aircraft, from the U.S.’s F-35 Lightning II to Russia’s Su-57, reflects the technological advancements and strategic priorities of their respective nations.'

    'Sales Reach 160 Million Units, PlayStation 2 Becomes Best-Selling Game Console of All Time',

    'Sony recently confirmed that PlayStation 2 (PS2) has reached 160 million units worldwide in sales. This announcement strengthens PS2\'s position as the best-selling game console of all time. This achievement is difficult to match by other consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, which is currently nearing that figure with sales of 146 million units.',
    'The announcement of PS2\'s sales figures also coincides with the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the PlayStation brand. Sony has launched a special web page to celebrate the significant achievements of all PlayStation console generations, from PlayStation 1 to PlayStation VR2.\n\nSony began their journey in the console world after the split with Nintendo in the early 1990s. The first PlayStation, released in 1994, paved the way for the great success of PS2.\n\nAs reported by Eurogamer, Sony reported that the PS2 had sold more than 150 million units in 2011, just 11 years after its launch in March 2000. In the following year, this figure increased by 5 million units. Although PS2 production was discontinued in January 2013, sales of this console continued for several years, proving its extraordinary appeal.\n\nAmidst the popularity of the recently released PlayStation 5, which has reached 65 million units, the PS2 remains the gold standard in terms of game console sales. Other consoles such as the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo DS have also managed to achieve high sales figures, with 117 million and 154 million units respectively, but have not yet surpassed the dominance of the PS2.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch, released in 2017, has become the closest competitor with 146 million units sold as of September 2024. However, Switch sales are starting to slow down in anticipation of the next generation release, the Switch 2, planned for 2025. This situation makes the possibility of Switch surpassing the PS2 even smaller.\n\nThe success of the PS2 is attributed to several key factors. The console offered backward compatibility with PlayStation 1 games, providing users access to hundreds of classic game titles.\n\nAdditionally, the PS2 also pioneered the ability to play DVDs, which was a revolutionary technology at the time. This made the PS2 not only a game console, but also a multifunctional entertainment device that was attractive to a wider range of consumers.\n\nIn addition to its technical features, the rich collection of PS2 games was a major attraction. Titles such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Final Fantasy X, and Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater have become cultural icons that are remembered to this day.'

    'On December 3, 1994, the first PlayStation was launched in Japan as a game console rivaling Nintendo\'s existence. Until now, PlayStation has become one of the game console kings in the world.',
    'The success of PlayStation originated from a failed attempt to collaborate with another successful console company. As quoted from britannica.com, before releasing PlayStation on December 3, 1994, Sony Computer Entertainment tried to collaborate with Nintendo to release the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console. Unfortunately, the collaboration offer was rejected, so Sony released PlayStation on its own in 1994, then released it in the United States in 1995.\n\nOn the first day of its release, PlayStation console sales reached 100,000 units. In its development, they were initially unsure whether their console game would focus more on 2D sprites or full polygon 3D games. However, upon seeing the success of Virtua Fighter, Sony was determined to choose 3D graphics as the main focus of the PlayStation console.\n\nSurprisingly, PlayStation was able to rival Nintendo as the most popular console at the time. Several game series, such as Ridge Racer, Twisted Metal, and Final Fantasy, became the foundation of the popularity of the first PlayStation. In 2005, PlayStation became the only game console in the world to surpass one million copies in sales.\n\nThe success of the first PlayStation series or PS1 was followed by the release of PlayStation 2 in 2000. PlayStation 2 managed to reach one million copies sold faster than its predecessor series. PlayStation 2 was known as a console that could be accessed by many people at the same time. Because, at that time, PlayStation 2 was sold at a reasonably affordable price.\n\nIn addition, several game series released for PlayStation 2 were also sold at affordable prices. Nevertheless, the quality offered by PlayStation 2 was able to rival other consoles, such as Xbox, GameCube, and so on.\n\nDespite the great success of PlayStation 2, the introduction of PlayStation 3 did not experience the same success. Coming with various latest technologies, PlayStation 3 was sold at a very high price at that time. Therefore, many PlayStation fans then hesitated to buy it and chose to continue playing PlayStation 2.\n\nVarious game developers who were previously diligent in releasing new series for the PlayStation series did not release any game series for PlayStation 3 at all. This then caused PlayStation 3 to have no games to play at the beginning of its release.\n\nAfter a considerable failure in PlayStation 3 sales, Sony launched the PlayStation 4 in 2013. As reported by Dunia Games, PlayStation 4 had adopted advanced processor technology with the AMD Jaguar x86-64 eight-core. PlayStation 4 also had a futuristic design with futuristic controllers as well.\n\nIn 2020, Sony released its latest console, the PlayStation 5. This console has the most unique design compared to previous versions. Similar to the previous generation, this newest Sony console still uses AMD processor chips. PlayStation 5 brings cutting-edge technology such as the presence of Ultra HD Blu-Ray Disc, SSD NVMe PCIe Gen 4, and support for ray tracing.\n\nOther than introducing consoles, PlayStation also released portable consoles such as PSP, PSP Go, and PSP Vita. However, these portable consoles could not compete with console sales.'

    'Chairperson of the Subgroup for Environmental Pollution Prevention, Tiyana Brotoadi, said the compliance rate rose when residents were threatened with a looming fine in case of failing the emissions tests.\n\n"In 2022, without fines, the compliance rate was only 5.7 percent. In 2023, when fines were applied, it rose to 21.4 percent. In 2024, the increase was insignificant, around 23 percent," said Tiyana on Tuesday, December 3, 2024.\n\nTiyana said the data collection will serve as the basis for policy follow-up. Tiyana said the Jakarta government aims to increase the compliance rate for the vehicle emissions tests.\n\nFurthermore, Tiyana went on, testing the exhaust gas emissions of vehicles is important to minimize air pollution. "To encourage public compliance, policies like this are necessary. Based on this data, we aim to increase the people’s compliance with emission tests," said Tiyana.\n\nTo measure the data and promote compliance with emissions tests, the Jakarta Environmental Office held free emissions tests in Jalan Perintis Kemerdekaan, North Jakarta.\n\nThe testing today ran from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., targeting 400 vehicles, including cars and motorcycles.\n\nBased on Tempo\'s observation at the location, the vehicles that underwent testing also included cargo trucks and tank trucks. Tiyana stated that the Jakarta Environmental Office collaborated with the Transportation Agency and the Jakarta Metro Police in today\'s activities.\n\nThe emissions tests targeted random vehicles that passed by the road. “These vehicles are asked to stop for the police to conduct the inspection,” said Tiyana, adding that no fines were imposed on the vehicles that failed the emissions test today.'

    'The Paris commercial court was ruling on an emergency injunction sought by the SEPM union, which represents magazine staff in France.',
    'A Paris court on Wednesday ordered Google to halt a project that would allegedly see the search giant suppress some media articles in search results. The Paris commercial court was ruling on an emergency injunction sought by the SEPM union, which represents magazine staff in France. The union alleged that the search giant was going to start testing on Thursday a scheme under which it would remove from search results some articles from media with which it was clashing over rights for the use of online news. Google, however, said the project was a "time-limited experiment" to evaluate the influence of content from European publishers on users\' search experience. Google and other online platforms have in recent years been accused of making billions from news without sharing the revenue with those who gather it.\nTo tackle this, the European Union created a form of copyright called "neighbouring rights" that allows print media to demand compensation for using their content. France has been a test case for the rules and, after initial resistance, Google and Facebook both agreed to pay some French media for articles shown in web searches. Google and SEPM have been negotiating over neighbouring rights for several years. The Paris court on Wednesday ordered US-based Google LLC, Google Ireland and Google France "to not proceed to test" the reported scheme, or risk a fine of "300,000 euros each", according to the court order seen by AFP. SEPM, which includes 80 media groups, welcomed the order, which it said would "preserve the interests of the French press". Google said it was "surprised" by SEPM\'s stance, saying it was seeking to collect data because "independent administrative authorities and press publishers have asked us for more information on the impact of the display of news content in our search engine." In March, Google was fined 250 million euros by France\'s competition authority for failing to meet some of the commitments it has made on the issue of neighbouring rights.  The Alphabet Group subsidiary is not alone in its disputes with French media over using content without payment.  Accused of bad faith negotiations, social media network X (formerly Twitter) was sued this month by leading French media groups, such as Le Monde, Le Figaro and Le Parisien. Agence France-Presse is suing X over the same issue with a court hearing set for May 15, 2025.'

The four-member Crew-8 mission splashed down off the coast of Florida early Friday after nearly eight months aboard the orbital laboratory. On its way back to Earth, the SpaceX Dragon executed a normal re-entry and splashdown, and recovery of the crew and spacecraft was without incident, NASA said in a blog post. But during routine medical assessments on the recovery ship, an "additional evaluation of the crew members was requested out of an abundance of caution," it added, without elaborating. NASA astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Grebenki were all flown to Ascension Sacred Heart Pensacola. Three were subsequently released, while one of the NASA astronauts remains at the hospital "under observation as a precautionary measure." NASA said it would not disclose specific medical information to protect the crew member\'s privacy but would provide updates as available. Later on Saturday, the NASA astronaut was released in "good health," the US space agency said. NASA did not reveal which of the astronauts was hospitalized nor the reason, citing medical privacy. However, it said in a blog post that the crew member has returned to the Johnson Space Center in Houston "in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members."'

    'Many of the images and videos of children being "hurt and abused are so realistic that they can be very difficult to tell apart from imagery of real children".',
    'Europe\'s biggest hotline dedicated to finding and removing child sexual abuse material generated by artificial intelligence (AI) said Friday that it had removed more websites in the past six months than the entire previous year. Many of the images and videos of children being "hurt and abused are so realistic that they can be very difficult to tell apart from imagery of real children", said the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). The rise of powerful generative AI models has facilitated the creation of the material, which is regarded as criminal content in the UK. From April 2023 to March 2024, the IWF said it had "actioned", or found and removed, 70 reports. From April 2024 up to the end of September 2024, it actioned 74 reports. Almost all the content was found on publicly available areas of the internet, with most of it hosted in Russian (36 percent), the United States (22 percent) and Japan (11 percent). More than three-quarters of the reports came from members of the public who stumbled across the criminal imagery, with the rest actioned by IWF analysts. "People can be under no illusion that AI generated child sexual abuse material causes horrific harm, not only to those who might see it but to those survivors who are repeatedly victimized every time images and videos of their abuse are mercilessly exploited," said Derek Ray-Hill, interim chief executive of the IWF. "To create the level of sophistication seen in the AI imagery, the software used has also had to be trained on existing sexual abuse images and videos of real child victims shared and distributed on the internet. "Recent months show that this problem is not going away and is in fact getting worse," he warned, urging lawmakers to bring legislation "up to speed for the digital age."'

    'AI has supercharged weather forecasting, using a range of statistical tools to analyze years of historical data and predict patterns, and at a lower cost than traditional numerical weather predictions.',
    'When floods ripped through parts of Europe in September, the scale of the destruction took people by surprise. The intense rains should not have, because those had been predicted by sophisticated forecasting systems enhanced with artificial intelligence. But forewarned did not mean forearmed. Though the rains were accurately predicted, the effects in the deluged areas were not - a fact that highlights the difficulties of dealing with ever more common extreme weather. AI has supercharged weather forecasting, using a range of statistical tools to analyze years of historical data and predict patterns, and at a lower cost than traditional numerical weather predictions. AI technology can create more specific predictions ahead of events such as urban flooding or in complex terrain such as mountainous areas. For example, Google-funded GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data, was found to outperform traditional models. Reanalysis data relies on past forecasts rerun with modern forecasting models to provide the most complete picture of past weather and climate. But there are still gaps in knowledge, in how the information in used and in investment to strengthen data gathering models, experts say. "In some cases and for some variables, AI models can beat physics-based models, but in other cases vice versa," said Andrew Charlton-Perez, professor of meteorology at the University of Reading in the UK. One issue is that the effectiveness of an AI model is only as good as the information it is fed. If there is little input data, or extreme events happen more frequently at different times of the year or in different regions, weather disasters become more challenging to predict. "A good use of the AI-based weather forecasts would be to complement and enhance our forecasting toolbox, perhaps by allowing us to produce larger ensembles of forecasts that enable accurate assessment and interpretation of the likelihood of extreme events," Charlton-Perez added. Communication is key Since January, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), an independent organization that provides predictions four times per day to European countries, has been using the Artificial Intelligence/Integrated Forecasting System (AIFS). This data-driven forecasting model makes multiple predictions rapidly and delivers long-term forecasts of weather events like cyclones and heatwaves. The ECMWF readings ahead of the September floods were accurate, experts say. Thomas Wostal, press officer for meteorological observatory GeoSphere Austria, told Context/the Thomson Reuters Foundation that their numerical models - including the ECMWF\'s predictions - foresaw 300-400 millimeters of rain locally, which came to pass. But even with accurate forecasts, scientists say communication is key, especially in an era when climate change means extreme weather is becoming more frequent. "I think what happened with [the recent floods] ... is that it\'s so rare - a one in 150- to 200-year event - that even if the weather models capture it, there\'s a reasonable degree of uncertainty," said Shruti Nath, a postdoctoral research assistant in predicting weather and climate at Oxford University. "You have to produce the warning in a way that is communicative, in the degree of severity it could possibly have on people, then people could see the cost of inaction versus the cost of action is actually much greater. So then they would actually put [in] more resources," she said. Europe behind the curve? Europe faces urgent climate risks that are outpacing policies and adaptation actions, a report from the European Environment Agency has warned. Extreme heat, drought, wildfires and flooding will worsen in Europe even under optimistic global warming scenarios and affect living conditions throughout the continent, the EEA says. After the floods, the European commissioner for crisis management, Janez Lenarčič, said the disaster was not an anomaly. "These extreme weather events that used to be once in a lifetime are now an almost annual occurrence. The global reality of climate breakdown has moved into the everyday lives of Europeans," he said. Some tech entrepreneurs say Europe is not ready. Jonas Torland, co-founder of Norway-based 7Analytics, which develops models for predicting floods and landslides, said governments and businesses in the United States had risk managers who were more accustomed to assessing environmental hazards, while in Europe, authorities lacked readiness. "We often see substantial expenditures with minimal data support for informed decision-making", Torland, whose models are used in the cities of Oslo, Bergen and Kristiansand, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. "While AI is a crucial component of these models, unfortunately, governments are not investing in or purchasing these advanced AI solutions," he said adding that he believed governments "stick to their old data providers and consultants.” Data processing is also a challenge because these complex AI models need to run updates every hour as forecasts change. That requires both a lot of computing power, and a lot of time - especially at more minute scales. A 1-by-1 metre grid, which 7 Analytics uses for its predictions, is 100 times more detailed than a 10-by-10 metre grid, but requires more than 100 times as long to process. High computing power also means huge amounts of energy and water are needed, which makes AI models part of the problem because they are adding to the planet-heating emissions driving the climate emergency. Some big technology companies, like Microsoft and Google, are exploring the use of nuclear power to run their huge data storage centres. Other scientists stress that beyond refining their forecasting abilities, authorities need to invest in physical solutions, like developing areas where floodwater can safely be stored, and early warning systems. They also need to minimise development in flood-prone areas, given the likelihood of more intense climate change-driven floods, and meet their commitments to limit emissions. "It\'s not a question of data or technology or knowledge. It\'s a question of implementation, political will," Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at Imperial College in London, said in an email response to questions. "As long as the world burns fossil fuels, the root cause of climate change, extreme weather events will continue to intensify, killing people and destroying homes. To curb this trend, we need to replace oil, gas and coal with renewable energy."'

    'The AFF Cup 2024 Group B qualifying match at the Manahan Stadium in Solo, Central Java, will be tightly secured by the joint police and military team. The Indonesian national team will play two matches at the stadium.',
    'First, the Garuda team will host Laos on Thursday, December 12, 2024. Second, the team led by Shin Tae-Yong will face the Philippines National Team on Saturday, December 21, 2024. The chief of the Solo City Police Resort, Commissioner Iwan Saktiadi, said they will deploy a total of 890 personnel to secure the games at the Manahan Stadium. The security will be divided into two rings. The first ring of the stadium will be guarded by stewards. The joint TNI-Polri team will secure rings 2 and 3. "If there is an emergency, we will enter the field upon the request of the senior officer in charge of security," Iwan said at the Solo City Police Resort Headquarters, Central Java, on Tuesday, December 10, 2024. He added that they will also secure both teams while in Solo. Security measures will be taken at the hotel, during training, and at the Manahan Stadium. The Indonesian national team players arrived in Solo, Central Java, two days before the match. Together with coach Shin Tae-Yong and staff, they landed at Adi Soemarmo Airport, Boyolali Regency, Central Java, on Tuesday, December 10, 2024, at 6:45 p.m. local time. Before boarding the bus to the hotel, Indonesian national team defender Dony Tri Pamungkas talked about their preparation for the match against Laos on Thursday, December 12, 2024. He admitted that the recovery time is quite short. "For the preparation, because the recovery is quite short, we have to prepare as best as we can," said Dony. Indonesia won 1-0 in the match against Myanmar at the Thuwunna Stadium in Yangon on Monday, December 9, 2024. A total of 24 Indonesian National Team players arrived in Solo on Tuesday evening. This means that they have only two days to prepare before the next match.'

    'The Indonesian Football Association (PSSI) Chair Erick Thohir has expressed Indonesia\'s strong interest in hosting the 2031 Asian Cup as the sole host nation. Erick, who also serves as the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, confirmed that an official proposal has been submitted to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).',
    '“Indonesia has submitted a bid to become the sole host of the 2031 Asian Cup,” Erick announced in Jakarta on Tuesday, December 10, 2024. He said the document was signed by him and PSSI General Secretary Yunus Nusi. “Our previous hosting experience was in 2007, a joint effort with Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This time, we aim to be the single host in this prestigious event,” he added. The Indonesian national team previously hosted the Asian Cup in 2007. However, this was a joint hosting endeavor with three other Southeast Asian nations. PSSI believes that Indonesia is now fully prepared to take on the role of sole host. The successful hosting of the U-17 World Cup last year serves as strong evidence of the country\'s organizational capabilities and the availability of FIFA-standard stadium facilities. The 2031 Asian Cup will be held two editions from now, providing approximately seven years of preparation time should Indonesia\'s bid be successful. The upcoming 2027 Asian Cup will be hosted by Saudi Arabia. Throughout its 68-year history, Southeast Asian countries have only twice been appointed as the sole host of the Asian Cup: Thailand in 1972 and Singapore in 1984. Since then, no other ASEAN nation has been selected for this prestigious role.'

Erick explained that the government has increased the annual funding allocation for PSSI from Rp150 billion to Rp227 billion. The fund distribution will commence gradually in January 2025 with an initial disbursement of approximately Rp25 billion. Although all PSSI programs are not dependent on the government, he highlighted that this increased support is invaluable and proves appreciation for the high level of performance achieved by Indonesian football. “Personally, I am extremely grateful,” he said. He further elaborated that an estimated Rp 500-600 billion is required to finance all PSSI programs, including national team programs across all categories. In addition to government support, PSSI has forged partnerships with 25 private sector entities, now serving as PSSI associates. These private-sector collaborations have generated approximately Rp400 billion in funding. Erick announced that, with the combined budget from the government and private sector, PSSI will commence the implementation of new programs in January 2025 to further enhance performance. These programs include long-term training camps for the Indonesian Women\'s National Team to prepare them for the AFF Women\'s Championship, a highly competitive tournament featuring teams like Thailand and Vietnam. Furthermore, preparations for the U-17 and U-20 national teams, who will compete in the 2025 Asian Cup, will be intensified.'

    'Naturalisation for Timnas Indonesia: Fair or Not?',

    'The debate around the issue of having naturalised athletes as part of the Indonesia National Football Team seems to have reached the point of no return.',
    'In the football world, naturalisation is not a new concept. It has been practised for years, with many countries adopting the approach, including Indonesia. Indonesia National Football Team (or in Indonesian: Timnas Indonesia) has not achieved a good result in the last decades. Substituting coaches and players does not present Indonesia with prestigious trophies. Even in the AFF Cup, a tournament for Southeast Asian countries, Indonesia has never claimed the title; runner-up is the best result they have achieved. Of course, this situation has left many Indonesian citizens frustrated. How is it possible that, with a population of 280 million, the country cannot find its best 11 players? Indonesia has its own domestic football league, namely Liga 1 (previously known as Indonesia Super League). However, the level is still lower than the neighbouring football leagues, such as Malaysia Super League and Thai League 1, whose league champions will compete in the AFC Champions League Elite. Meanwhile, the champion of Liga 1 can only compete in the AFC Champions League Two qualifying play-off. The quality of the football league is undoubtedly influenced by the quality of its players. Furthermore, Liga 1 has a regulation to limit the recruitment of foreign players to improve the quality of local players, but this does not really help. If you watch a Liga 1 match, you will notice how bad most of the players are. The ones that play quite well are actually the foreign players. That is why, since Erick Thohir was appointed the head of PSSI (Persatuan Sepakbola Seluruh Indonesia or the Indonesian Football Association), more foreign players have been naturalised to play for Indonesia, given their superior quality, at least at the Asian level. Thohir also brought in South Korean coach Shin Tae-yong, who led the South Korean national team in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, to manage Timnas Indonesia. The combination of naturalised players and a well-experienced coach is, hopefully, able to bring Indonesia to a higher level. The naturalisation process is certainly not that easy and cannot be done carelessly. Still, Thohir has to select qualified players who have Indonesian blood in their veins — literally. Today, the naturalised players come from the Netherlands since most of them have Indonesian blood from their father or mother or even grandparents. Today, there are 11 naturalised players in the Indonesia national team squad. All those players are selected because they are playing in the highest level of international football league, such as the Premier League in England, Serie A in Italy, Eredivisie in the Netherlands, and Major League Soccer in the United States. Although they do not play for big teams, they compete with international-level teams in each league, which can improve their playing style and skills. Nonetheless, player naturalisation has sparked debate among Indonesian football pundits and local players. Critics argue that it is unfair to select players who have recently changed their citizenship to represent the national team, rather than choosing local players who have been playing in Indonesia for years. Also, in a YouTube podcast, a local player mentioned that the quality of naturalised players and local players is quite similar, but the difference lies in the fact that the naturalised players are playing abroad, while the locals are playing in Indonesia. With better quality, no wonder PSSI will choose naturalised players to play for Indonesia National Football Team. This strategy has already shown results. Evidently, with this current squad, Indonesia has risen to the 129th place in the FIFA World Standing, which was previously in the 173th. This makes Indonesia the third-ranked ASEAN country after Thailand (100th) and Vietnam (116th). Furthermore, the team has made history by reaching the third round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers for the first time. Overall, this proves that the inclusion of naturalised players has significantly boosted Indonesia’s football quality — at least for now. After all, just like a football match, anyone can be a game-changer.'

    'On Tuesday, the 26th of November, Indonesia Expat had a chance to catch the jukebox musical before its cast and crew shared their insights regarding the school’s most ambitious stage production yet.',
    'If there’s one takeaway from the latest stage production from British School Jakarta (BSJ), We Will Rock You, it’s that no one should ever underestimate a school musical. Opened to the public on the 25th, the 26th, and the 28th of November, 2024 at the esteemed BSJ World Theatre, for approximately two hours and a half, the dedicated teachers and the exceptionally gifted students of BSJ adapted the jukebox musical, based on the songs of British rock band Queen with a book by Ben Elton, as they exceeded every expectation with both humour and show-stopping vocals. Krystal Waltho, the creative director and producer of We Will Rock You who also happens to be the BSJ’s Head of Arts Department, revealed that the idea to adapt the jukebox musical as the school’s latest production came from Stephen Tomlinson, the school’s Head of Music Department who also served as the music director of the production. “I just saw the aesthetic for it,” Waltho said as they reminisced on the show’s pre-production. “I just saw that, you know what, we need a massive video screen in there, the lighting, the sound, that rock atmosphere, the fog, and even the fireworks. It just came to me straight away.” Waltho knew that her grandiose vision required a “wonderful combination” of “great music director, and then great directing, and acting here”. And of course, professionals are not the only ones who could reach for the stars. “And I started calling us the ‘all-stars’ because I do think we are an all-star cast with an all-star production, all-star technician, an all-star school,” Waltho continued. “So, for me, it was a no-brainer in that sense. And, also, the play looks at individuality and how you can stand out from the crowd.” But there’s more to We Will Rock You than blowing the minds of the public as well as the Melophiles. The musical production takes place in a far-distant, Orwellian future where a young man named Galileo refuses to conform to the oppressed society. Waltho observed how the story might also resonate with the youth’s struggle with anxiety and their desire to find their place in the world. As Waltho deftly put it: “This musical, it deals with those issues and it makes kids realise that they can be great as individuals and they’re perfect as they are.” In developing the production, at least for Tomlinson, it was all about fusing showmanship with education. “You do build [the musical] around [the students],” Tomlinson remarked. “So, a lot of it is just having that knowledge of what they’re passionate about, what they’re good at. And I think we really wanted to do this for the students.” That being said, anyone who is familiar with Queen’s discography would agree that songs like “Somebody to Love”, “Bohemian Rhapsody”, “No One But You”, and “I Want It All” are not exactly the easiest songs to be vocally performed on a live stage. To boot, the teachers understood that their cast members were still in adolescence, which means that their vocals were not yet fully developed. It took extra care, training, and attention for everyone to hit the right note. When all’s said and done, as the curtains closed, We Will Rock You was performed by and for the students. “For me, everything’s about the students and giving them the best life experiences. They’re going to go to America, they’re going to go to Europe, they’re going to go to these universities, and they’re going to have this West End, Broadway experience that we’ve given them, right? […] And they’ve got it here in Indonesia,” Waltho concluded.'

    'Matt Dearden’s journey from computer programmer to bush pilot in Papua is the kind of story that grabs you by the collar and refuses to let go.',
    'A British commercial pilot with an appetite for adventure, Matt’s career took a dramatic turn when he traded the safe, predictable world of programming in the UK for the skies of Indonesia. He set his sights on something bigger, something wilder — landing a job with Susi Air. Seven years of flying through the uncharted and dangerous landscapes of Papua transformed Matt’s life, his experiences in this remote frontier became the heart of his memoir Flying from Shangri-La. His story, both in the air and on the page, is one of resilience, daring, and the human spirit’s hunger for something more.\n\nHello Matt, can you tell our readers a bit about yourself? Who is Matt Dearden?\nI’m a British commercial pilot and author who started life in the UK working as a computer programmer. I re-trained as a pilot in 2009 but due to the recession, I was unable to find a job in Europe so I looked worldwide and found Susi Air. I then lived and worked in Indonesia for seven years, starting as a co-pilot for Susi Air on their Cessna Caravans before being upgraded to Captain. I eventually ended up flying the Pilatus Porter bush plane in Papua which reshaped my entire life and idea of what being a commercial pilot is.\n\nWhat inspired you to write Flying from Shangri-La?\nI’ve always enjoyed reading true stories of people who have lived interesting lives and who have done things different from the normal life most people lead. I knew the sort of flying and the life I was leading with Susi Air was unique and as yet, no one had written a book about it. So, I kept a diary with the intention of writing the book one day. Like many authors, the covid lockdowns provided me with the time to get it done.\n\nMatt with His AircraftMatt with His Aircraft\nHow did your experiences flying in Papua shape the stories you chose to include?\nPapua is one of the world’s last frontiers. Plane crashes are sadly quite common. It’s incredibly remote, dangerous, and offers some of the most extreme flying on the planet. The local people are interesting and still live relatively primitive lives which are being modernised by the continued development of the major towns and cities there. The mountains and weather create a unique and challenging flying environment which demands very skilled pilots to safely navigate over. Almost any time you left your front door, a story would unfold as it’s just a unique place.\n\nIn writing this book, you had to transition from being a pilot to a writer chronicling his experiences. Was it difficult to capture the thrill and intensity of flying in such a remote region in words?\nI’m quite lucky in the sense that writing comes quite naturally to me which is strange because I’m actually quite dyslexic. Thankfully, it only seems to affect my ability to read rather than write. I have been told that my writing style is very good and easy to read. At times, it was tricky to encapsulate just how exciting and dangerous some events were, but I’m told by those who’ve read the book that I did a pretty good job!\n\nYour book appeals to both aviation enthusiasts and those looking for adventure stories. How did you strike a balance between the technical aspects of flying and the more personal, human stories in your writing?\nI knew the primary audience would be aviation enthusiasts, but it was important to me that anyone can read this book. Any time I did need to write about something technical, I ensured to keep the language simple so anyone can understand it. I’ve had many readers tell me they’ve learned a lot about flying and being a pilot from my book. There’s plenty of non-flying stories in there which I’m sure many of your readers will relate to from living in Indonesia themselves.\n\nThe Air Strip in PapuaThe Air Strip in Papua\nIs there a particular chapter or story in the book that you feel best encapsulates the essence of flying in Papua?\nHalf of the book is devoted to my experiences in Papua, so it’s very difficult to pick just one story! I think the following couple of paragraphs give a good taste of what flying in Papua is like; for more, you’ll have to read the book!\n\nThere was a small layer of cloud as I climbed away from Timika but I was soon above it as Puncak Jaya came into view. The beauty of the mountain ranges was stunning as you climbed up towards them. It would start with thick, dense jungle covering everything in trees over 100 feet high. These slowly thinned out as you got higher, eventually ending up as jagged rocks and cliff faces. The route to Beoga takes you to the east of the really big peaks but it still required climbing to 13,000 feet to clear the ridge just before the upper plateau at around 10,000 feet. Any time spent above 12,000 feet required supplementary oxygen from the on-board supply, which I’d use whilst cruising past the ridges before descending down towards the plateau.\n\nCrossing this wet, desolate marshland then brought you towards the Beoga valley which you then descended down into for the approach. Once again, the thick tall trees would appear and you had to hug the side of the valley as close as you could to manage the descent rate and keep an eye out for fog forming ahead. Assuming none, you kept coming down into the valley with the mountains now towering thousands of feet above you and giving you this incredible sense of just how small and insignificant you were in your little aeroplane.\n\nFlying from Shangri-La has received great reviews. What has been the most surprising or rewarding feedback you’ve received from readers so far?\nI think the most rewarding comments I’ve had have been from both people I’ve inspired to get into aviation and from people who have been struggling with their mental health. Before I left the UK for Indonesia, I was struggling with a general anxiety disorder and I felt it important to write about this in the book. Mental health in aviation is often not discussed and I want readers to know that it’s ok to talk about it, even as a pilot, and that by doing so things will get better.\n\nAfter the success of Flying from Shangri-La, do you have any upcoming projects or plans for another book? Perhaps more stories from your aviation career, or even something entirely different?\nI suspect I will write another book in the not-too-distant future, although I haven’t decided what on yet. Outside of my job flying a corporate aircraft for its owners around Europe, I fly, instruct and examine pilots on a 1943 WWII Catalina flying boat which is definitely something a bit different that people are always asking me about.'

    'Pamungkas ‘Hardcore Romance’ Review: His Least Interesting, Most Awkward Album to Date',

    'The pop-rock singer-songwriter’s fifth original studio album feels more like a confusing déjà vu than a confident step into a new era.',
    'This is not an easy review to write.\n\nSince his debut album, 2018’s Walk The Talk, Pamungkas has consistently and resolutely positioned himself as a trailblazer. The singer-songwriter’s combination of unvarnished charm and unapologetic vision was a much-needed breath of fresh air back in the late 2010s and the early 2020s — a period of time when most male artists were too focused on being a clean-cut, prefabricated boy next door. The enormous success of Walk The Talk, as well as his sophomore album, 2019’s Flying Solo, became a prime example of the best that the Indonesian independent music scene had to offer. Simply put: Pamungkas made the word “indie” cool again. And, regardless of a few controversies that popped up every now and then throughout his career so far, no one could ever question his creative bravado.\n\nSadly, that bravado is (almost) nowhere to be found in Pamungkas’ fifth original studio album, Hardcore Romance, released on the 21st of August, 2024.\n\nRegardless of whether anyone is willing to acknowledge this or not, history has proven how being a thirty something is more of a challenge than an opportunity for an artist. It is usually the chapter of life in which an artist starts running out of ideas and needs to work harder — physically, mentally, and even emotionally — to continue getting in touch with their creative soul. Pamungkas, now 31 years of age, still deserves praise for having enough energy to churn out another full-length album. Perhaps he discovered his energy to make Hardcore Romance by looking back at the spirit of his early oeuvre — and it shows quite palpably too.\n\nIn terms of lyrical approach and melodic variations, the songs encompassing Hardcore Romance pretty much echo the ones in both Walk The Talk and Flying Solo. While the 2021’s Solipsism 0.2 and the 2022’s Birdy were more creatively challenging as well as thought-provoking, Hardcore Romance, just like Walk The Talk and Flying Solo, is simpler, emotive, and more youthful in spirit.\n\nBut here’s the problem: Pamungkas is not that twentysomething artist anymore.\n\nAs I wrote before: Hardcore Romance is simpler, emotive, and more youthful in spirit than his prior records — but it also feels awkward and forced. Considering his experience as a pro, Pamungkas is (supposed to be) wise enough *not* to come up with something as basic as “One Bad Day”. The album’s opening number, which sounds more like a brash cousin of Daniel Powter’s “Bad Day”, does not at all reflect Pamungkas’ growth as an artist. Lines such as “Take me out/Take me to somewhere/Closer to you” sound more like something that a rookie would come up with as opposed to someone who has been a professional musician for almost seven years now. The album’s third number, “New Feeling”, is another poor example of his shockingly weak songwriting. Pamungkas is usually a witty songwriter, but describing love as “such a nice feeling” is so far from being clever that it comes across as an underwhelming cop-out instead.\n\nFrom the narrative and linguistic perspectives, Hardcore Romance is much easier to understand and much more accessible to mainstream audiences than Birdy — but what’s the point of being understandable if it means sacrificing its artistic depth? Despite the tepid streaming numbers of Birdy, that particular album continues to stand out to this day thanks to Pamungkas’ clever examination of what it feels like to be on the delicate crossroad between emotionally charged young adulthood and the soul-stirring, permanent adulthood. Mainstream audiences might have not been able to completely appreciate Birdy, but at least it was a very interesting record to dive into. With Hardcore Romance, it seems like Pamungkas has deliberately avoided offering complexity as well as multi-dimensionality. Hardcore Romance, as a result, is the polar opposite of Birdy: it is not an interesting record.\n\nTo be fair, Pamungkas has tried to make Hardcore Romance somewhat interesting, though the outcome does not make much difference. Music production-wise, Hardcore Romance channels the gritty, rock-‘n-roll warrior within the artist. “I Love About You” is a rare opportunity for him to showcase his skills in the slacker rock subgenre, resulting in a very polished music production. Unfortunately, not even such production quality can redeem the song’s superficial nuance. (Although, in hindsight, I don’t think there is any music producer out there who could imbue soul to sentences like “We’re kissin’ each other’s face/And you see me/I see you/I thought it was cool.”)\n\nHardcore Romance, however, reaches its peak clumsiness with “Putus”. Even though it may seem exciting to see Pamungkas co-writing with someone else, this mid-tempo number, ultimately, ranks as one of Pamungkas’ weakest songs of his entire career. Almost all of the elements within the song, from start to finish, are loaded with the familiar vibe of Dewa 19 to the point where “Putus” sounds more like a proposed demo track for the legendary band as opposed to being Pamungkas’ original piece. In addition, even the most hardcore romantics out there would agree that lines such as “Yang bukan bibirmu/Yang bukan bola matamu/Yang selain dirimu/Putus” are just too bizarre to listen to — let alone, to sing along to.\n\nThese glaring issues, I believe, could easily be resolved if only Pamungkas had been willing to cover all the bases. His growth as a music producer has taken one step forward, but his growth as a songwriter, as evident in Hardcore Romance, has fallen three steps behind. Meanwhile, his growth as a singer has taken a worrying direction as well. His experimentation with adding raspiness to his vocal textures in Hardcore Romance is pretty much notable, especially in “Wanna Be Yours” and “Fight Some More”, but this, ultimately, adds nothing to the songs’ emotional richness. To begin with, Pamungkas is not exactly the most versatile singer, which means having him sing in a manner that is unnatural to his default mode ends up making his voice sound sickly as opposed to swaggy. This could cause actual, physical damage to his vocal cords if Pamungkas were not careful.\n\nUltimately, it is difficult to figure out what actually went on in Pamungkas’ mind when he worked on Hardcore Romantics. He does not put enough effort into the elements that are the most vital, but he tries too much in certain aspects that should not require any thought at all. Reading the press release of the album, he might genuinely wish to return to the so-called ‘zero’ point. Ironically, at this point in his career as well as his life, Pamungkas should be experienced enough to understand that trailblazing talent means nothing without good judgment.'

    'Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was confronted with six new sexual abuse lawsuits on Monday, including one accusing the rap mogul of assaulting a minor. The civil lawsuits were filed a month after Combs was criminally charged for what prosecutors describe as a long-running scheme of sex trafficking and racketeering. Combs has denied wrongdoing in other civil cases against him and pleaded not guilty in his criminal case. \"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone - adult or minor, man or woman,\" Combs\' lawyers said in a statement Monday. The lawsuits were filed in New York federal court by anonymous plaintiffs, including one man who accuses Combs of assaulting him when he was a minor.'
